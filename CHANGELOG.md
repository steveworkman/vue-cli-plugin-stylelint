# CHANGELOG

## 2.2.0 (01-09-2020)

### Added

- You can now specify `rules` as options to be added to the stylelint config

## 2.1.0 (31-08-2020)

- Forked from @samhammer/vue-cli-plugin-stylelint

### Added

- Support for `config: "scss"`

### Fixed

- Install now works from a Vue CLI Preset. It removes the task that auto-lints files on install as no files were properly staged at that time in a CLI present scenario.
